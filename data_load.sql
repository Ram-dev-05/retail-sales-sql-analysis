--copying the data into staging raw table from csv file

/*
performed the data import using the psql command-line client's \copy command instead of pgAdmin's SQL COPY command because:

- The SQL COPY command runs on the PostgreSQL server and requires the CSV file to be accessible from the server's file system, which often causes file access or permission errors in client environments.
- The \copy command runs client-side in psql, allowing loading from files on the local client machine, avoiding server file permission issues.
- This approach ensures a smooth import of CSV data from local Windows directories without requiring server-side file access.
- Encoding issues were managed by converting the CSV file to UTF-8 or adjusting client encoding temporarily.
