# Retail Sales SQL Analysis Project
This project showcases a comprehensive SQL data analysis workflow for a retail sales business. It includes database schema design, data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and advanced querying using window functions. The goal is to extract actionable business insights and demonstrate practical SQL expertise for data analysis roles.


## 1. GitHub Repository Setup
The project repository was initialized with a descriptive name and a foundational README. Proper version control was established using `.gitignore`.  
- Related files: `.gitignore`, `README.md`

## 2. Data Modeling
The database schema was modeled, including key entities (Customers, Products, Orders, Sales, Regions). The ER diagrams visualize relationships and normalization steps.

## 3. Database Creation
SQL scripts were developed to create normalized tables with appropriate keys and constraints, forming the backbone of the data structure.
- Related file: `create_tables.sql`

## 4. Data Loading
Data was loaded into the database using both manual SQL `INSERT` statements and bulk-loading from CSVs, ensuring all tables were properly populated.

## 5. Data Quality and Validation
Comprehensive checks and cleaning were performed to ensure data integrity, removing duplicates, filling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies.

## 6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (in progress)
Basic analysis and summary queries were executed to discover trends, totals, and distributions within the data.

## 7. Advanced SQL Queries (in progress)
Window functions and performance optimizations are being implemented for deeper insights and efficient querying.

## 8. Business Insights (in progress)
Key findings and analytical conclusions are documented to summarize project impact and business value.

Files are organized by function, making navigation intuitive.  
- All primary scripts and documents are in the root directory.
- Data and diagrams are updated as the project evolves.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository  
- Run `create_tables.sql` and `data_load.sql`  
- Clean and validate with relevant scripts  
- Analyze data as needed
